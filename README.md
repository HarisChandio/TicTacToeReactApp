- State Management: `useState` hook is used to manage and update state within functional components, enabling interactive behavior.

- Props and Event Handling: Passing data between components using props and handling events, such as button clicks.

- Conditional Rendering: UI elements are conditionally displayed based on game status, such as showing the winner.

- Time-Traveling through History: The game history is managed to allow users to revisit previous game states.

- JSX: JSX syntax is used to write HTML-like code within JavaScript for defining UI elements.

- React Hooks: `useState` hook is showcased for state management in functional components.
